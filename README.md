This where I implement and test various Deep Learning Architectures to simulate neuro science concepts. Not only that I do have implemented some known architectures from scratch.

Only Some trials led to good results and become there own project and repository.
But I believe that every experiment is a learning experience. So I keep all of them here.

Here I have implemented the following architectures:

1. Surprise Mechanism from Scratch (models.ipynb)
2. Vision Encoder Extension (Modality adding to LLMs, basically Cross Attention Adapter) [VisionEncoderExtension.ipynb]
3. Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) Paper Implementation (HRM/ and models.ipynb)
4. Self Organizing Map (SOM) from Scratch (SOM.py)
5. Fourier VS Attention (FOURIER_VS_ATTENTION/)
6. Spiking Neural Networks with my theory of adding Long term Potentiation(RealtimeLearning/)
